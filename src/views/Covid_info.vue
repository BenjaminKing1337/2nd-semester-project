                <h2>COVID-19</h2>
                <p>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. </p>
                <p>This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. </p>
                <p>COVID-19 is now a pandemic affecting many countries globally. </p>
                <p>Most people have only a small risk of becoming seriously ill if they become infected with novel coronavirus, and particularly children and adolescents seem to be less affected and have mild cases of the disease. </p>
                <p>Generally speaking, 80% develop mild symptoms, 15% become seriously ill and require hospitalisation, and 5% require treatment in an intensive care unit. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that between 0,3% and 1% of those infected will die from COVID-19. That equates to 1 out of 100-300 people infected with COVID-19.</p>
                <h2>Who is at higher risk?</h2>
                <p>For people with some illnesses and conditions, there is a higher risk of a serious course of COVID-19 â€“ e.g. requiring hospitalisation and possibly intensive care.</p>
